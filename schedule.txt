V1: What must be done
Write discussion and talk about results - priority 1
Tie what I write about microervices into leading into why what I did was relevant to that
Tie in python code piece by piece in a chapter that displays all the steps I did to make the data better. 

What subchapters do I have left to write?
Finish 4.2 series length
4.3 should wrap up
4.4 Collection... make it 4.1?
Storage?
Where to write about the generation of data?
Make chapter 4 the entire thing about that?
in chapter 3 write methodology and make that the way to collect and store data?
What IS my methodology? I would say it is: 
Essentially what I've done: Create this system to stress test and generate data.
Then look at what needs to be done to make good use of that data. 
Then argue that through all this work, I have created a pipeline for both generating and preprocessing as well as visualizing the data.
