abstract = {Big data nowadays is a fashionable topic, independently of what people mean when they use this term. The challenges include how to capture, transfer, store, clean, analyze, filter, search, share, and visualize such data. But being big is just a matter of volume, although there is no clear agreement in the size threshold where big starts. Indeed, it is easy to capture large amounts of data using a brute force approach. So the real goal should not be big data but to ask ourselves, for a given problem, what is the right data and how much of it is needed.1 For some problems this would imply big data, but for the majority of the problems much less data is necessary. In this position paper we explore the trade-offs involved and the main problems that come with big data: scalability, redundancy, bias, noise, spam, and privacy.},

Days rewriting its core business software from monolithic architecture to a Web Oriented Architecture using microservices. The paper presents technical lessons learned during and from this migration by addressing three crucial questions for a successful context-adapted migration towards a Web Oriented Architecture: how to determine (i) the most suitable granularity of micro-services, (ii) the most appropriate deployment and (iii) the most efficient orchestration?},

@article{Heinrich2017,
abstract = {Microservices complement approaches like DevOps and continuous delivery in terms of software architecture. Along with this architectural style, several important deployment technologies, such as container-based virtualization and container orchestration solutions, have emerged. These technologies allow to efficiently exploit cloud platforms, providing a high degree of scalability, availability, and portability for microservices. Despite the obvious importance of a sufficient level of performance, there is still a lack of performance engineering approaches explicitly taking into account the particularities of microservices. In this paper, we argue why new solutions to performance engineering for microservices are needed. Furthermore, we identify open issues and outline possible re- search directions with regard to performance-Aware testing, monitoring, and modeling of microservices.},

@article{Du2018,
abstract = {With emerging container technologies, such as Docker, microservices-based applications can be developed and deployed in cloud environment much agiler. The dependability of these microservices becomes a major concern of application providers. Anomalous behaviors which may lead to unexpected failures can be detected with anomaly detection techniques. In this paper, an anomaly detection system (ADS) is designed to detect and diagnose the anomalies in microservices by monitoring and analyzing real-time performance data of them. The proposed ADS consists of a monitoring module that collects the performance data of containers, a data processing module based on machine learning models and a fault injection module integrated for training these models. The fault injection module is also used to assess the anomaly detection and diagnosis performance of our ADS. Clearwater, an open source virtual IP Multimedia Subsystem, is used for the validation of our ADS and experimental results show that the proposed ADS works well.},

@inproceedings{Sergeev2022,
abstract = {At the moment, Docker technology is becoming more prevalent in the Windows environment. The pertinent topic in this regard is how Docker containers running on the Windows operating system would behave in the event of a resource deficit. The article discusses circumstances in which there is insufficient processor or RAM to service all running containers. It is proposed to employ stress and volume testing to investigate the stability and reliability of Docker containers. The purpose of stress testing is to determine how the system behaves when the load on the application is greatly increased in comparison to what was initially expected. By delivering enormous amounts of data for processing, volume testing is accomplished. To assess container performance during stress testing, a Prometheus-based technology stack is used. Docker containers running in a Windows system have been shown to operate predictably under extreme load conditions. As the processor load increases, the performance of the containerized program drops proportionately to the decrease in processor time allocated. When there is insufficient RAM to run all containers, Docker uses virtual memory to dynamically distribute memory amongst containers. If a container's execution is halted due to a lack of available RAM on the system, the container's execution is terminated. Other containers continue to function normally.},

@article{Gropp2011,
abstract = {The performance of parallel scientific applications depends on many factors which are determined by the execution environment and the parallel application. Especially on large parallel systems, it is too expensive to explore the solution space with series of experiments. Deriving analytical models for applications and platforms allow estimating and extrapolating their execution performance, bottlenecks, and the potential impact of optimization options. We propose to use such "performance modeling" techniques beginning from the application design process throughout the whole software development cycle and also during the lifetime of supercomputer systems. Such models help to guide supercomputer system design and re-engineering efforts to adopt applications to changing platforms and allow users to estimate costs to solve a particular problem. Models can often be built with the help of well-known performance profiling tools. We discuss how we successfully used modeling throughout the proposal, initial testing, and beginning deployment phase of the Blue Waters supercomputer system. Copyright 2011 ACM.},
