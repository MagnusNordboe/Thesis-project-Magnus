    An application in which the user interface, business rules, and data access code is combined into a single executable program and deployed on one platform. A monolithic application operates independently from other applications, performing every step of the process needed to complete the entire business function. It does not share any logic or data across system or organizational boundaries. Databases are designed for access by single application systems within a single agency, not for access by multiple application systems in multiple agencies simultaneously.%

    MGDIS SA is a software editing company that underwent a major strategic and technical change during the past three years, investing 17 300 man. Days rewriting its core business software from monolithic architecture to a Web Oriented Architecture using microservices. The paper presents technical lessons learned during and from this migration by addressing three crucial questions for a successful context-adapted migration towards a Web Oriented Architecture: how to determine (i) the most suitable granularity of micro-services, (ii) the most appropriate deployment and (iii) the most efficient orchestration?%
