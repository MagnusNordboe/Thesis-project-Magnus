quality of the data
Signal to noise ratio
scalability

Idea for thing:

1: introduction. Abstract, keywords, research questions.
2: Background. Write about the state of microservices at time of writing, keep it to what's relevant to the paper
3: Research process:
The hypothesized idea about pregenerating a bunch of data with stress testing, locust, running it through machine learning algorithms. 
 Write about the decisions made, the choice of microservices-demo, the initial idea, refining it iteraitvley by seeing what comes out.
The process of treating the data so it can be fed into algorithms
4: The results. Lots and lots of graphs and data about the performance of the various methods of preprocessing and machine learning.
5: Discussion. Look at the resulting data and talk about what this means for the field.
6: Conclusion. Tell yourself you did a great job.

compare scaling across all instances vs scaling per instance, with assumption that scaling per instance is better.
