What we want to do is:
1. Generate folders/files with examples.
2. These file names need to be unique. Timestamp should work. Unix time, keep the now_unix() variable. 
2. Labels should be inferred from the directory name.
3. Then make tool that gets label names to generate array of labels to go with the thingamajigs.
