The method to compare these dataframes reduce the columns to only those found in all time series. This is because of a technical 
limitation of sktime, pandas, and most TSC algorithms. 
How to deal with the MultiIndex?
I probably want to use some auto-generated names then, and just keep the labels in a separate list.
Send in tuple, get out tuple.

Bruh help

All right lets think properly about This
Now I need to pass in 'y' parameter
After that I need enough generatedstuff

Bias in the data: Some types of data that comes out serves no purpose other than confuse the learning algorithm.
The case of go_gc_duration: In most cases(of stable running), it only tracks how long the thing has been running. 
This leads to a erroneous bias where, if having collected the types of training data in batches, it will wrongfully
associate the value range with the type of stress the system is under. Solution: Change monotonoically increasing values
to only display the change per timestamp, then train for handling (mostly) static data. This can be a blessing and a curse.
If training data includes some spikes where the stress is enough for the service to crash, it would be useful to include.
Otherwise, it is simply useless noise.
